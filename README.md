# LinkWarden API Wrapper
This is a simple Python wrapper for the LinkWarden API, it's still a work in progress, for now I only decided for the broader structure and implemented the simpler classes.
I still have to figure out some details of how the actual api works which I still haven't got the time to do.

Completed classes are highlighted in [PROGRESS.MD](PROGRESS.MD)
